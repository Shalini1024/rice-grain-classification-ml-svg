# 🌾 ML Project: Rice Grain Classification using SVM

## 📘 Project Overview
This project is a simple machine learning experiment created to develop a better understanding of the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm.

The dataset contains rice grain samples with varying **sizes and proportions**.  
Using these features, the model predicts **which group or category** a particular rice grain belongs to.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand and apply the **Support Vector Machine** algorithm for classification.  
- To explore and analyze feature relationships in the rice grain dataset.  
- To train and evaluate an SVM model for accurate prediction of rice grain groups.

## 📂 Dataset Description
- The dataset includes multiple observations of rice grains.  
- Each record contains numerical features such as **length, width, and aspect ratio**, among others.  
- The target variable indicates the **type or group** of rice grain.
